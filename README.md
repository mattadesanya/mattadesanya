### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ±

I wrote my first hello-world program in QBASIC 20 years ago. Since then, I've built apps, led small teams and an entire engineering department. I've programmed in Java, Javascript, PHP, Python to name a few.

I currently work as an Engineering Manager, which means that I don't get to code much during the day. My work is everything between humans and computers.  

Most evenings and weekends, I shapeshift into a [bull](https://github.com/mattoranking).

Besides work, I blog, teach and practice new chords on my guitar or piano.
